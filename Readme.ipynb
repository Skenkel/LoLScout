    "### Purpose:\n",
    "In the 5 v 5 Videogame/Esport two teams of 5 players compete against each other. \n",
    "Before the 'Game' start each player chooses 1 of (currently 133) characters, known as a champion. No two players may play the same champions. \n",
    "In ranked and professional play, players may \"ban\" a champion and prevent either side from choosing that champion. \n",
    "There are several common strategies for this 'Pick/Ban' phase:\n",
    "1. Ban the \"strongest\" champion. \n",
    "2. Ban the champions that are strongest against champions your team is planning on picking. \n",
    "3. Ban the champions that (in professional play) you know your opponents are most succesful/ skilled with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a team only has 5 bans, and every banned champion is banned for both teams, evaluating these three goals (and which 5 champions are worth banning) is a difficult task for professional League of Legends teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project was to make classifier (Team 1 winning being the target), that would help answer the question of how to optimally do pick ban, and to use that classifier's output to answer the above questions. \n"
